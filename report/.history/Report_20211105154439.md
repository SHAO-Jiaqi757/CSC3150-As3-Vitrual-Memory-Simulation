  ### Background

  
## Design methods
* LRU 
  > Data Structure
  ```cpp
  struct Node
  {
    u16 prev;
    u16 next;
  };

  struct LRU
  {
    Node* head;
    Node* tail;
    Node* nodes;

    u16 count = 0;  

  };
  ```
  ![](./LRU_struct.png) 

  Fig1. The data structure used in LRU 

  The LRU is a array based doubly linked list.
  There are 1026 nodes, where the first node and the last node are sentinels. \
  For each node, it contains `prev` and `next` (16bits for each). The value of `prev` and `next` is the index of the LRU array, which also indicates the frame number. Since the frame number starts from 0, we can use `index-1` to get `frame_number`. \
  Once the `frame_number k` is accessed, the LRU array will be updated by calling `update_LRU()`. The *least recently unused*  `frame_number` can be obtained from `tail->prev - 1`.
  

  > Functions
  ```cpp
  /*virtual_memory.h*/
  __device__ void update_LRU(VirtualMemory* vm, u16 frame_number);
  __device__ u16 get_LRU_frame_number(VirtualMemory* vm);
  ```

  ```cpp
  /*virtual_memory.cu*/
  __device__ void init_LRU(VirtualMemory *vm);
  __device__ void add_to_LRU(VirtualMemory *vm, u16 frame_number);
  __device__ void update_LRU(VirtualMemory *vm, u16 frame_number);
  __device__ u16 get_LRU_frame_number(VirtualMemory *vm)
  ```

  `init_LRU` is used to initialize the LRU–putting the LRU into the virtual memory. \
  `add_to_LRU` is used to add node in the front of the doubly linked list. \
  `update_LRU` is used to update the LRU once a frame is accessed. \
  `get_LRU_frame_number` is used to get the *least recently unused* `frame_number`, which will be swapped out later.

* vm_read \
  ![](./vm_read.png) \
  Fig.2 Flowchart of wm_read


* vm_write \
  The design of `vm_write` is similar to `vm_read`. \
  Therefore, I simply my function `vm_write` and `vm_read` as following: 
  ```cpp
  __device__ uchar vm_read(VirtualMemory *vm, u32 addr)
  {
    u32 phy_addr = get_physical_addr(vm, addr);
    return vm->buffer[phy_addr];
  }

  __device__ void vm_write(VirtualMemory *vm, u32 addr, uchar value)
  {
    u32 phy_addr = get_physical_addr(vm, addr);
    vm->buffer[phy_addr] = value;
  }
  ```
* vm_snapshot \
  The `vm_snapshot` uses `vm_read` to put data in buffer to `results`.
  ```cpp
  __device__ void vm_snapshot(VirtualMemory *vm, uchar *results, int offset,
							int input_size)
  {
    for (int i = 0; i < input_size; i++)
    {
      results[i + offset] = vm_read(vm, i);
    }
  }
  ```
## Problem encountered
* How to implement LRU algorithm? \
  If using counter to record the *least recently unused* frame, it need to iterate all to get the target frame, and the time complexity is O(n). However, using doubly linked list (DLL), it can get the target frame in O(1), and update the LRU in O(1). Therefore, using DLL is more efficient.
* How to know the IPT is full? \
  A: The `count` of `LRU` indicates the number of valid frames in IPT. Thus, if `count == PAGE_ENTRIES`, the IPT is full, so we need to swap out the *least recently unused* frame.
    ```cpp
    // swap out
    free_frame = get_LRU_frame_number(vm);
    u32 old_vpn = vm->invert_page_table[free_frame];
    for (int i = 0; i < vm->PAGESIZE; i++)
    {
      vm->storage[old_vpn * vm->PAGESIZE + i] = vm->buffer[free_frame * vm->PAGESIZE + i];
    }
    ```
* How to handle page fault? \
  A: 
  1. The IPT is not full: `free_frame = count`; 
  2. The IPT is full: find the frame to swap out => `free_frame`. \
   
  In the end, swap disk data into `free_frame`


## Execution
* The submitted folder tree is like: 
    ```
    .
    └── src
        ├── 3150-cuda.sln
        ├── 3150-cuda.vcxproj
        ├── 3150-cuda.vcxproj.user
        ├── CMakeLists.txt
        ├── build.sh
        ├── data.bin
        ├── kernel.cu
        ├── main.cu
        ├── test.bin
        ├── user_program.cu
        ├── virtual_memory.cu
        └── virtual_memory.h

    1 directory, 13 files
    ```
* Run `build.sh` to build the project
  ```
  $ build.sh
  ```
* After build finished, a *build* folder will be generate, where contains an executable file `cuda`
* Run and Execute `src/build/cuda` 
  ```
  input size: 131072
  pagefault number is 8193
  ```
  In the `user_program.cu`:
  ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < input_size; i++)
        vm_write(vm, i, input[i]);

    for (int i = input_size - 1; i >= input_size - 32769 i--)
        int value = vm_read(vm, i);

    vm_snapshot(vm, results, 0, input_size);
  ```
    &nbsp; Since the input_size is 131072, thus, there will be 131072/32 = 4096 page faults in `vm_write`. In the end, the physical memory contains 32768 bytes data. \
    &nbsp; Moreover, in the second for loop, it reads data from 32769 addresses, where the last address with offset `input_size-32769` causes one page fault. \
    &nbsp; In `vm_snapshot`, there will be 131072/32 = 4096 page faults. \
    &nbsp; Therefore, the total page fault is 4096 + 1 + 4096 = 8193
* After execution, it generates an output file `snapshot.bin`
* Compare the difference between `snapshot.bin` and `data.bin`
  ```
  $ diff ./data.bin ./snapshot.bin
  Binary files ./data.bin and ./snapshot.bin differ
  ```
  That indicate there is no difference between the two files.
